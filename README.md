This is a portfolio website created following FES bootcamp week 2's video on E-portfolio.

I've added some functional links such as my personal GitHub, LinkedIn, and discord.

I have NOT created assets for my own projects or resume yet, as this will be done as I complete the bootcamp.

If I ever use this as my portfolio website, I'll need to add these files into assets.
